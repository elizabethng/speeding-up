# Why parallelism? Boils down to 3 reasons:

1. Code too SLOW

2. Problem too BIG

3. Tasks too MANY

#### Modern processor architectures accomodate multiple **cores** and **processors**

_It’s not as simple as it may seem._
_While in theory each added processor would linearly increase the throughput of a computation, there is overhead that reduces that efficiency._
_For example, the code and, importantly, the data need to be copied to each additional CPU, and this takes time and bandwidth._
_Plus, new processes and/or threads need to be created by the operating system, which also takes time._
_This overhead reduces the efficiency enough that realistic performance gains are much less than theoretical, and usually do not scale linearly as a function of processing power._
_For example, if the time that a computation takes is short, then the overhead of setting up these additional resources may actually overwhelm any advantages of the additional processing power, and the computation could potentially take longer!_
_In addition, not all of a task can be parallelized_

_A downside is that you need to explicitly copy over any needed data, functions._
_But the upsides are that spawning a new process can be done on a remote machine, not just current machine. So you can in principle use entire clusters._

_The foreach package is based on another style of iterating through data - a for loop - and is designed so that one can go from serial to several forms of parallel relatively easily. There are then a number of tools one can use in the library to improve performance._

# Working serially with `foreach`

The standard R for loop looks like this:

```r
for (i in 1:3) print(sqrt(i))
```

```
## [1] 1
## [1] 1.414214
## [1] 1.732051
```

The foreach operator looks similar, but returns a list of the iterations:

```r
library(foreach)
foreach (i=1:3) %do% sqrt(i)
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 1
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 1.414214
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] 1.732051
```

---
class: left, top
# Working serially with `foreach`


```r
library(foreach)
foreach (i=1:3) %do% sqrt(i)
```
`foreach` creates an object &amp; `%do%` operates on the code (here just one statement,
but it can be multiple lines between braces, as with a for loop) and the `foreach` object.

---
class: left, top
# `foreach`  &amp;  `doParallel`

Foreach works with variety of backends to distribute computation - `doParallel`, which allows snow- and
multicore-style parallelism   

Switching the above loop to parallel just requires registering a backend and using `%dopar%` rather than `%do%`:


```r
library(doParallel)
registerDoParallel(3)  # use multicore-style forking
foreach (i=1:3) %dopar% sqrt(i)
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] 1
## 
## [[2]]
## [1] 1.414214
## 
## [[3]]
## [1] 1.732051
```

```r
stopImplicitCluster() # used to close implicit clusters
```

---
class: left, top
# Key functions

- `detectCores()`: returns # of cores you have access to for computation

- `makeCluster()`: creates the cluster (i.e. set of copies of R) that run in parallel &amp; communicate over sockets (potentially)

- `registerDoParallel()`: registers parallel backend for `foreach`


```r
ncores &lt;- detectCores() - 1

# Make it a socket cluster - DEFAULT
cl &lt;- makeCluster(ncores, type='PSOCK')

# Make it a forking cluster
cl &lt;- makeCluster(ncores, type='FORK')

registerDoParallel(cl)
```

---
class: left, top
# Key functions

`stopCluster(cl)`
Shuts down the processes (i.e. quitting each R). Best practice to use, supposedly unnecessary if you exit R (which automatically closes everything). If not stopped, the processes continue running &amp; using resources causing slowing or delays.

Supposedly weird things can still happen (cores remain in use, processes still run), so use this to draw out those creepers in the shadows:

```r
unregister &lt;- function() {
    env &lt;- foreach:::.foreachGlobals
    rm(list=ls(name=env), pos=env)
}
unregister()
```

# Combining results

Default is to return a list, but there are numerous ways to combine results:

```r
foreach (i=1:3, .combine=c) %do% sqrt(i)
```

```
## [1] 1.000000 1.414214 1.732051
```

```r
foreach (i=1:3, .combine=cbind) %do% sqrt(i)
```

```
##      result.1 result.2 result.3
## [1,]        1 1.414214 1.732051
```

```r
foreach (i=1:3, .combine="+") %do% sqrt(i)
```

```
## [1] 4.146264
```

```r
foreach (i=1:3, .multicombine=TRUE, .combine="sum") %do% sqrt(i)
```

```
## [1] 4.146264
```

---
class: left, top
# Combining results

Most of these are self explanatory.

`multicombine` is worth mentioning: by default, `foreach` will combine
each new item into the final result one-at-a-time.

If `.multicombine=TRUE`, then you are saying that you're passing a function
which will do the right thing even if foreach gives it a whole wack of new results as a list or vector -
*e.g.*, a whole chunk at a time.

---
class: left, top
# Nesting `foreach`

- There's one more operator: `%:%`.  This lets you compose or nest foreach objects:

```r
foreach (i=1:3, .combine="c") %:% 
  foreach (j=1:3, .combine="c") %do% {
    i*j
  }
```

```
## [1] 1 2 3 2 4 6 3 6 9
```

# Other tips with `foreach` &amp; `doParallel`

Can suffer same inefficiencies as a `for` loop if looping over MANY iterations

for example:

```r
  ans &lt;- foreach (i=1:2000, .combine="+") %do% {
    ...
  }
```
creates a vector that takes memory

---
class: left, top
# Other tips with `foreach` &amp; `doParallel`

## Possible solution:

Foreach has _iterators_ (e.g. `icount`) that can iterate through an object without creating something the size of the object.

for example:

```r
  ans &lt;- foreach (i=icount(2000), .combine="+") %do% {
    ...
  }
```

---
class: left, top
# Other tips with `foreach` &amp; `doParallel`

## Better solution:
Avoid the intermediate index altogether because we don't care about `\(i\)`, we care about the data. So we either implicitly iterate:

```r
  ans &lt;- foreach (i=DATA$VARIABLE_1(2000), .combine="+") %do% {
    ...
  }
```

---
class: left, top
# Other tips with `foreach` &amp; `doParallel`

## Better solution:
OR explicitly iterate by 'chunking:

```r
  ans &lt;- foreach (i=iter(DATA$VARIABLE_1(2000),chunksize=500),
                  .combine="+") %do% {}
```
OR even by row, column, etc if your object is a matrix or data frame

```r
  ans &lt;- foreach (i=iter(DATA_MATRIX,by="row"), .combine="+") %do% {}
```
This works in parallel too.

---
class: left, top
# Other tips with `foreach` &amp; `doParallel`

Chunking is just one of several ways `foreach` adjusts the iteration scheduling

For instance, you can use options from `multicore` (if using a `multicore` cluster)

```r
foreach( ..., .options.multicore=list(preschedule=FALSE,set.seed=TRUE))
```

Another is if you don't care about the order that the results come back in, use:

```r
foreach( ..., .inorder=FALSE)
```
to allow flexibility in sending out tasks (otherwise, first result is ALWAYS from first iteration, etc.)

---
class: left, top
# Other tips with `foreach` &amp; `doParallel`

Some (or many) times you will want to save much more than can be returned by `foreach` (e.g. multiple files).

--

You can write files from within `foreach` **BUT** make sure you save in new directory created in each new process

--

Sometimes you want to externally write to the same file from within `foreach` with `%dopar%`, but separate processes that simultaneously attempt to open a file will crash parallelization

--

Use `flock` package

```r
library(flock)

locked &lt;- lock("directory/file.dat")
write.table(X,file="file.csv",append=TRUE)
unlock(locked)
```

---
class: left, top
# Summary of `foreach`

Since it is a wrapper for `multicore` &amp; `snow`, it inherits pros &amp; cons of each

I prefer to use it because:

1. I (perhaps naively) rely on `for` loops already making the transition easy

2. You don't have to commit to `multicore` or `snow`; just switch to either in `doParallel` by registering the backend

3. You can incrementally improve code performance

## Don't reinvent wheels

There's no one-size-fits-all-analysis approach to taking advantage of multiple processors or nodes

Check to see if there already exists packages for doing your analysis in parallel.

## Big chunks better than little chunks

_E.g._ running each cross-validation fold on a different processor VS running them sequentially but with parts of the training method parallelized.

# Best practices

## Parallelism boosts computational power

For throwing more cores at the problem to help, the calculation has to have been limited by compute power
(some analyses, such as **I/O bound computations**-completion time determined by amount of time spent reading/writing from disk-or **network-bound**-timed determined by transfer-,can actually perform worse)

---
class: left, top
# Best practices

## One task per core, no more

CPU-bound (time to completion determined by speed of central processor) computations slow down if something else is sharing the processor with them.

Except for debugging(?), best not to run `doParallel` with more cores than you
have on your computer _(never actually tried)_.

.footnote[from [Beyond Single-Core R by Jonathan Dursi](https://ljdursi.github.io/beyond-single-core-R/#/)]

---
class: left, top
# Best practices

## Don't trip over your own feet

Because you only want one task for core, be careful about accidentally using parallelism (mostly with higher-level packages)

_e.g._ If you're 
- doing four tasks at once with multicore on your laptop, and
- Each of those tasks calls a routine with "baked-in" parallelism to launch 4 threads

Now you're competing with yourself for your own laptop's cores.

# **Exercise**: Remember Using Catch to Predict Status?

Costello et al. 2012 used a regression of catch + life history to predict B/Bmsy

Let's give it a try ourselves (in way fewer lines of code than the original)

1. Load in data and tidy it up

2. Test out some candidate regressions, select best

3. Test regressions on actual out-of-sample prediction
  - is "best" still best?

Data are in `here::here("data","ram_timeseries.csv")`

# `Rcpp` and C++

Check out [Chapter 25 in Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/rcpp.html#sourceCpp) for more on `Rcpp`

There he mentions some good references to learn C++ for free:

# **Exercise**: 'Speeding up' your own code

Try install prof.vis &amp; run on your own R code from research, work, fun(??)

```r
install.packages("profvis")

profvis({
  # Your code...
})
```

# Cloud computing

Despite expanding the bounds, we always seem to catch up 

You can find yourself still trapped by the multi-core processing power of your personal laptop, lab's desktop, etc. 

The easiest and cheapest next step is through the cloud....

# Cloud computing

The cloud contains on demand _virtual machines_ (an emulation of a computer running inside another computer)

_Virtual machines_ can perform all &amp; more of same operations as your own computer, and may even share same OS or internal architecture

To access _virtual machines_ within the cloud, all you need is internet connection, browser, and cash (ha)

Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, and Google are provide their own clouds (apparently RStudio has its own cloud service too, but has narrowly focused applications such as for teaching)

# Cloud computing

- Consider joining the [Research Computing Club](https://depts.washington.edu/uwrcc/)

  - Grants you access to [Hyak](https://uw.service-now.com/sp?id=sc_entry&amp;sys_id=bbcd76e1db12bb8037ae9ec6db961948&amp;sysparm_category=d103f865dba2bf40d6a77a8eaf9619b2), UW's own supercomputer, and the [Cloud Credit Program](http://depts.washington.edu/uwrcc/getting-started-2/cloud-computing/)
  
  - you must submit an application for the Cloud Credit Program, but applications for credits under $500 are approved ASAP (funded by the Student Technology Fund)
  
  - Pro: the only requirement is to attend one club event a year
  
  - Con: several hoops to jump through &amp; steep learning curve especially with Hyak - the payoff may be worth it though!
